# Gemini Bot

## Description

This project is an AI chatbot that uses the Gemini API from Google. It's designed for educational purposes, providing a practical example of how to implement a chat bot using Gemini API.

The chatbot has the following features:

- **Multi-Conversation**: The chatbot can handle multiple conversations at once. It initializes the chat by calling `startChat()`, and then uses `sendMessage()` to send new user messages. These messages, along with the chatbot's responses, are appended to the chat history.

- **User and Model Roles**: The chatbot uses two roles: 'user' and 'model'. The 'user' role provides the prompts, while the 'model' role provides the responses.

- **Streaming**: The chatbot uses streaming for faster interactions. Instead of waiting for the model to complete the entire generation process, the chatbot can handle partial results for quicker responses.
